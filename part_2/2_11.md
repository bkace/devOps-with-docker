### 2.11

Currently I am working on a project that requires building an REST API using FASTAPI framework to start and stop a charging station.

I have created a Dockerfile and docker-compose file to set up a development environment. 
The Dockerfile 
- makes use of python image (python:3.8-slim-buster),
- creates the working dir for the container,
- copies the `requirements.txt` file to the container
- and installs it using pip install requirements.txt.

The docker-compose file 
- Create a service for rest api 
 	- builds the   docker image from the Dockerfile in the 	project directory.
    - Use volume to modify the container locally
    - Use the command `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload`

With reload the application restarts if it notices any code changes
